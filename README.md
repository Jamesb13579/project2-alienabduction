# Project Two: Alien Abduction game

I created this game as a new version of hangman. One that is more in tune with modern society.

The aim for the game is for people to be able to enjoy guessing words based around alien abduction. With simple animations to keep people attention.

## User Stories
__As a new user__

- I would be like to be able to easily navigate the game.
- I would like to be able to be able to play intuitively.

__As an existing user__

- I would like to see regular updates to the word to be guessed, so the game doesnt get boring to quickly.
- I would like to be able to access this website on the go, so good mobile responsiveness is important.

## Design
__Theme__

As I was making a game about aliens I wanted to imagery and fonts to be suitable. The font that I used is __Josefin Sans__ and __Perminent Marker__. I felt this suited the style of game I was trying to create, the font is available from [google fonts](https://https://fonts.google.com/).


__Color Scheme__

The color scheme was chosen using a complimentry color generator, which I play with until I found the options that seemed right to me.

__Photos and Icons__

I created images suitiable to the game using paint

__Wireframes__

For this project I created one wireframe for how I wanted the game to look. I did change things as I built the game, as trial and error changed how I liked it.
